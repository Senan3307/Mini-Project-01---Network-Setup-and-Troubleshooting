# Mini-Project-01---Network-Setup-and-Troubleshooting

Choose software and hardware
  Decide what the objective is. In this case, it would be to create a network between multiple LANs. Thus, we would require switches, routers, end devices, WAP, ethernet cables, servers, etc. 

IP assignments
  It would be most efficient to assign IPs beforehand to minimize confusion and human error. For this project, network ranges 192.168.0.0/26 and 172.16.0.0/24 have been assigned. 
Device  | IP
------------- | -------------
Default Gateway (Router)  | 192.168.0.1
Default Gateway (Router)  | 172.16.0.1

Add end devices (PCs/laptops/printers/tablets/etc)

Add switch

Connect the end devices to the switch with ethernet cables

Add mobile devices

Add WAP

Connect WAP to a switch

Set IP address on end devices (mobile devices included)

Add a router to talk to different networks

Connect the switches to the router with ethernet cables

Configure IPs on router

Set Port Status to ON on router

Set default gateway on all end devices/hosts
